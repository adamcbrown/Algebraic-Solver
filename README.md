The algebraic solver can currently evaluate expressions without variables.
It can evaluate addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponential and logorithmic expressions
It can handle constants such as e or pi
It can parse negitive values in equations
Logs can be used by typing log(100), ln(e^2), or log2(1/2)
